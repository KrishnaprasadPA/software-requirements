**EffortLogger V2.0**

This is an upgrade on the already existing EffortLogger Application modelled and developed by Prof.Lynn Robert Carter of ASU for a client. The current tool tracks the effort and defect logs of the employees of the client's company. The new EffortLogger should focus on providing Privacy, Security and Support for Enterprise-Scaled Agile. The documents have been developed in phases and the final document has all the details required by a Software Engineer to develop the application.

**Planning Poker Tool**

The client's organization needs a Planning Poker Tool to assist the Planning Poker Sessions. The main concerns of the client include reaching a data-driven story point estimate as opposed to an opinion based method like Wideband Delphi, and to reduce the duration of these sessions. The students have formed a group of 4. We have gathered the requirements and plotted down the flow of the document with user stories, concept of operations, use cases, requirements upto architectural elements and detailed design. The students have also prepared a demo video explaining the various parts of the final document.
